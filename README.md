Download the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip to your personal folder: yourfolder/.

Unzip the data: yourfolder/UCI HAR Dataset/

Open run_analysis.R and run the code. It will read the data into R and
	- Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	- Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
	- Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	- Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
	- Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject, called tidy_data_with_averages.txt.

Use data <- read.table("tidy_data_with_averages.txt") to read the data into R.
